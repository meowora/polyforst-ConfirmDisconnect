# multiloader-multiversion-template

A multiversion, multiloader template powered by Archloom and Stonecutter. Made for Fabric & NeoForge.

This template is made primarily suited for my own needs, but should be very simple to edit what you need!

In terms of buildscript, most of what needs to be changed is in gradle.properties and the root project name in settings.gradle.kts

Don't forget to change the license, some information in the FMJ, and the author field in neoforge.mods.toml!
